# Password-Manager
DESCRIPTION - Hey peeps nimo here, so I had problems remembering all the different passwords for hundreds of sites and i didn't want to trust some random apps on the internet, so i created this database base system to maintain all your passwords in a safe encoded way. The amazing part of this is that even if the database is hacked or leaked all your passwords are stored in the encoded hash which no one can understand and only you can see it as only you have the key

# Installation
Pip3 install mysql.connector
Pip3 install cryptography

USAGE - You can use this project for storing your passwords locally or remotely on a server so you will never be able to forget your passwords :)
